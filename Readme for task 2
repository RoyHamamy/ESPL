Task 0: Using gdb(1) to debug segmentation fault
You should finish this task before attending the lab session.

C is a low-level language. Execution of a buggy C program may cause its abnormal termination due to segmentation fault â€” illegal access to a memory address. Debugging segmentation faults can be a laborious task.

gdb(1), the GNU Debugger, is a powerful tool for program debugging and inspection. When a program is compiled for debugging and run inside gdb, the exact location of segmentation fault can be determined. In addition, the state of the processor registers and values of the variables at the time of the fault can be examined.

The source code for a buggy program, count-words, is provided in file count-words.c. The program works correctly most of the time, but when called with a single word on the command line, terminates due to segmentation fault.

Write a Makefile for the program.
Specify compilation flags appropriate for debugging using gdb.
Find the location and the cause of the segmentation fault using gdb.
Fix the bug and make sure the program works correctly.
The tasks below are to be done only during the lab session! Any code written before the lab will not be accepted.
Task 1: Understanding memory addresses and pointers
Logical virtual memory layout of a process is fixed in Linux. One can guess from the numerical value of a memory address whether the address points to:

a static or a global variable,
a local variable or a function argument,
a function.
Here is a useful link (in addition to what you've heard in class).

T1a - Addresses
Read, compile and run the addresses.c program (remember to use the -m32 flag).
Can you tell the location (stack, code, etc.) of each memory address?
What can you say about the numerical values? Do they obey a particular order?

Check long data size on your machine using sizeof operator. Is long integer data type enough for dist (address difference) variables 

T1b - Distances
Understand and explain to the TA the purpose of the distances printed in the point_at function.
Where is each memory address allocated and what does it have to do with the printed distance?

T1c - Arrays memory layout
In this task we will examine the memory layout of arrays.
Define four arrays of length 3 as shown below in the function main and print the memory address of each array cell.

int iarray[3];
float farray[3];
double darray[3];
char carray[3];
Print the hexadecimal values of iarray, iarray+1, farray, farray+1, darray, darray+1, carray and carray+1 (the values of these pointers, not the values pointed by the pointers). What can you say about the behavior of the '+' operator?
Given the results, explain to the TA the memory layout of arrays.

T1d - Pointers and arrays
Array names are essentially pointer constants. Instead of using the arrays, use the pointers below to access array cells.
int iarray[] = {1,2,3};
char carray[] = {'a','b','c'};
int* iarrayPtr;
char* carrayPtr;
Initialize the pointers iarrayPtr and carrayPtr to point to the first cell of the arrays iarray and carray respectively. Use the two pointers (iarrayPtr,carrayPtr) to print all the values of the two arrays.

Add an uninitialized pointer local variable p, and print its value (not the value it points to). What did you observe?

Task 2 - Structs and pointers to functions
Let us recall the following definition:
Pointers to functions - C allows declaring pointers to functions. The syntax is: function_return_type (*pointer_name)(arguments_list); for simple types of return value and arguments. You can read more about pointers to functions here.

The following code is the base file for task 2 - you should complete it as stated in the sub tasks.
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
 
char censor(char c) {
  if(c == '!')
    return '*';
  else
    return c;
}
 
char* map(char *array, int array_length, char (*f) (char)){
  char* mapped_array = (char*)(malloc(array_length*sizeof(char)));
  /* TODO: Complete during task 2.a */
  return mapped_array;
}
 
int main(int argc, char **argv){
  /* TODO: Test your code */
}
Please read the Deliverables section before continuing.

Task 2a
Implement the map function that receives a pointer to a char (a pointer to a char array), an integer, and a pointer to a function. Map returns a new array (after allocating space for it), such that each value in the new array is the result of applying the function f on the corresponding character in the input array.

char* map(char *array, int array_length, char (*f) (char));
Example:

char arr1[] = {'H','e','y','!'};
char* arr2 = map(arr1, 4, censor);
printf("%s\n", arr2); 
free(arr2);
Result:
Hey*
Do not forget to free allocated memory.

Task 2b
Implement the following functions.

char encrypt(char c); /* Gets a char c and returns its encrypted form by adding 2 to its value. 
          If c is not between 0x41 and 0x7a it is returned unchanged */
char decrypt(char c); /* Gets a char c and returns its decrypted form by reducing 2 to its value. 
            If c is not between 0x41 and 0x7a it is returned unchanged */
char dprt(char c); /* dprt prints the value of c in a decimal representation followed by a 
           new line, and returns c unchanged. */
char cprt(char c); /* If c is a number between 0x41 and 0x7a, cprt prints the character of ASCII value c followed 
                    by a new line. Otherwise, cprt prints the dot ('*') character. After printing, cprt returns 
                    the value of c unchanged. */
char my_get(char c); /* Ignores c, reads and returns a character from stdin using fgetc. */
Pay attention that array length is constant i.e. if the initial array is of length 5, then the new array that we receive with my_get function is of the same length.

Example:

int base_len = 5;
char arr1[base_len];
char* arr2 = map(arr1, base_len, my_get);
char* arr3 = map(arr2, base_len, encrypt);
char* arr4 = map(arr3, base_len, dprt);
char* arr5 = map(arr4, base_len, decrypt);
char* arr6 = map(arr5, base_len, cprt);
free(arr2);
free(arr3);
free(arr4);
free(arr5);
free(arr6);
Result: 
Hey! // this is the user input.

Do not forget to free allocated memory.
There is no need to encrypt/decrypt letters in a cyclic manner, simply add/reduce 2.

T2c - Adding an option to exit
Implement the following function:

char quit(char c); /* Gets a char c,  and if the char is 'q' , ends the program with exit code 0. Otherwise returns c. */
This function terminates the program "normally" and "successfully" using the exit function (as mentioned in the lab's reading material). The use of such a function will be clarified in task 3.

Task 3 - Menu
struct - A struct in the C programming language is a structured type that aggregates a fixed set of labeled items, possibly of different types, into a single entity similar to an "object".
The struct size equals the sum of the sizes of its objects plus alignment (if needed). You can get the size by using the sizeof operator as follows: sizeof(struct struct_name).
A function pointer can be a field in a structure, thus several functions can be accessed through a single data structure or container.

An array of function descriptors, each represented by a structure holding the function name (or description) and a pointer to the function, can be used to implement a program menu. Using the following structure definition:

struct fun_desc {
  char *name;
  char (*fun)(char);
};
Alternatively, you can define this as a "typedef" as shown in class.

Below is an example of declaration and initialization of a two-element array of "function descriptors":

struct fun_desc menu[] = { { "hello", hello }, { "bye", bye }, { NULL, NULL } };
Using the code from 2c, write a program called menu that performs the following.

Defines a pointer 'carray' to a char array of length 5, initialized to the empty string (how?).
Defines an array of fun_desc and initializes it (in the declaration, not as program code within a function) to the names and the pointers of the functions that you implemented in Task 2. The last fun_desc in the array should contain a null pointer name and a null pointer to function.
Displays a menu (as a numbered list) of names (or descriptions) of the functions contained in the array. The menu should be printed by looping over the menu item names from the fun_desc, not by printing a string (or strings) that contain a copy of the name.
Displays a prompt asking the user to choose a function by its number in the menu, reads the number, and checks if it is within bounds. The bound should be pre-computed only once, and before the loop where the prompt is printed. If the number is within bounds, "Within bounds" is printed, otherwise "Not within bounds" is printed and the program exits gracefully.
Evaluate the appropriate function over 'carray' (using map) according to the number entered by the user. Note that you should call the function by using the function pointer in the array of structures, and not by using "if" or "switch".
After calling any menu function (other than 'quit'), let 'carray' point to the new array returned by map( ).

Usage Example:
#> menu

Is it possible to call a function at an invalid address in your version of the program?

Bonus item (0 points) Add a menu item for "junk", where the pointer to function is initialized to point to something that is not known function code, such as your fun_desc array. Compile and run the modified program, and select the junk menu item. What do you observe?

The quit function
In task 2c we have defined the quit function as a function that gets and returns a char. This is an unusual implementation, however, it enabled us to nicely add a quit option to the menu that follows the same architecture of the assignment. We did not have to explicitly write a separate menu item for the quit option. Be that as it may, notice that it is a quick and dirty "trick" and it is not the generally recommended way of constructing menus.
